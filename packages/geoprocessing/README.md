# Geoprocessing

A framework for publishing low-cost and low-maintenance `geoprocessing` services and reports in the cloud.  Part of the [SeaSketch](https://seasketch.org/) ecosystem.

## What is this for?

This frameworks niche is running spatial analysis and generating reports quickly and simultaneously at scale, with different user input.  Then scaling down to near zero cost when not in use.

Often, the original analysis might be prototyped in an environment like R, Jupyter Notebook, ArcGIS, etc. and this framework can be used to "operationalize" the analysis at a cost, speed and scale that is difficult to match with other solutions.

## Who is this for?

It's specifically targeted to GIS practictioners, developers, and technical folks that want to create and host geoprocessing projects themselves, independent of any planning tool used. The SeaSketch team uses it for [all projects](https://github.com/mcclintock-lab?q=-next&type=&language=&sort=)
