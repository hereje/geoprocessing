# @seasketch/geoprocessing

A framework to create, combine, and publish geoprocessing `functions`, `datasources` and `client` reports for use in spatial planning tools.

Geoprocessing projects are designed to integrate with the [Seasketch](https://seasketch.org/) marine spatial planning platform, supporting continuous evaluation of user-designed planning areas (sketches) against science-based criteria.
