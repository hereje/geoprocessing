# Geoprocessing

A framework for publishing low-cost and low-maintenance `geoprocessing` services and reports in the cloud.  Part of the [SeaSketch](https://seasketch.org/) ecosystem.

## What is this for?

This frameworks niche is running spatial analysis and generating reports quickly and simultaneously at scale, with different input, over and over again, such as part of a collaborative spatial planning process.

Often, the original analysis might be prototyped in an environment like R, Jupyter Notebook, ArcGIS, etc. and this framework can be used to "operationalize" the analysis at a cost, speed and scale that other products out there can't match.

## Who is this for?

It's specifically targeted to code-savvy folks that want to create and host geoprocessing projects themselves and plug it into their SeaSketch project, though it is not dependent on SeaSketch.  The SeaSketch team uses it for all projects, here are some [public ones](https://github.com/mcclintock-lab?q=-next&type=&language=&sort=)
